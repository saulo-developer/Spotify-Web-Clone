Hey! My name is Saulo. I'm developing a project for a Spotify application (Web) from a clone, using Angular JS, Typescript, Bootstrap, Node JS.

I'm new to programming and I'm developing a Spotify clone with my own changes so I can practice the practical part of what I've been studying for some time.

This project owes all the credit to Sankat29 (original owner).
